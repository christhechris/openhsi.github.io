Brad’s research is focused on the use of Earth Observation, using spectral cameras, UAV’s, Aircraft, CubeSats and Satellites to enhance our understanding of the Carbon and Water cycle. In a practical sense, this involves mapping and modelling plant growth, crop yield and other plant related activities remotely. This research is achieved through using the state-of-the-art in sensors, Hyperspectral Imaging Spectrometers, Thermal imagers and a range of Multispectral and Spectroscopy based approaches.

Brad has been a Director of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network Ecosystem Modelling and Scaling Infrastructure, and Director of Sydney Informatics Hub.

In recent years, Brad has worked on novel ways of mapping plant growth (E.g. NASA’s OCO2 based Solar Induced Fluorescence based model: https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/10/13/new-technique-tracks-plant-photosynthesis-from-space.html) and innovative ways to improve existing approaches (Nature Plants: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-017-0006-8 ).
