# About
OpenHSI is a complete camera and software hyperspectral imaging system developed by staff and students at the University of Sydney, originally funded by The Commonwealth of Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG), Maritime Division. Ongoing work is currently funded by DSTG’s StarShot program on Remote Undersea Surveillance as part of the ‘More Together’ Strategy.

The OpenHSI projects goal is to proliferate deeper understanding of Hyperspectral Imaging Spectroscopy through making the system open, and providing best practice tools to create (3D print and assemble), calibrate and operate an imager, that is affordable for Science and Engineering specialists in Remote Sensing. To this end, the software uses OpenSource tools as much as possible including NASA’s 6S radiative transfer model through the Py6S python software.

The University of Sydney’s Associate Professor Sergio Leon-Saval and Dr Christopher Betters of the Sydney Astrophotonic Instrumentation Laboratory (SAIL) developed the first OpenHSI camera from previously published designs, adapting it to readily available materials, and thus incrementally changing the design, at the request of Dr Bradley Evans and his team from DSTG. 

The Australian Research Council funded training centre CubeSats, UAV and their applications (CUAVA) students Yiewei Mao (PhD Candidate) and Samuel Garske (PhD candidate) developed their software to support the camera as part of their PhD and have publications pending on their work. Professors Iver Cairns and Associate Professor K.C.Wong and Dr Bradley Evans supervise Yiwei and Sam. 

Robonation, co-organisers of the RobotX 2022 Event in Sydney, together with DSTG and funded by the Next Generation Technologies Fund, will use a version of the OpenHSI system in the Australian based event. 

Since the project commenced, University of Sydney supported start-up, Sydney Photonics, lead by Dr Christopher Betters will commercialise the technology and supply competitors in the RobotX 2022 competition with OpenHSI cameras developed for Robonation.

Join us in making use of this technology, help us enhance the communities understanding of hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy. We encourage you to participate in the community and support the work of the OpenHSI team.

Brad’s research is focused on the use of Earth Observation, using spectral cameras, UAV’s, Aircraft, CubeSats and Satellites to enhance our understanding of the Carbon and Water cycle. In a practical sense, this involves mapping and modelling plant growth, crop yield and other plant related activities remotely. This research is achieved through using the state-of-the-art in sensors, Hyperspectral Imaging Spectrometers, Thermal imagers and a range of Multispectral and Spectroscopy based approaches.

Brad has been a Director of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network Ecosystem Modelling and Scaling Infrastructure, and Director of Sydney Informatics Hub.

In recent years, Brad has worked on novel ways of mapping plant growth (E.g. NASA’s OCO2 based Solar Induced Fluorescence based model: https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/10/13/new-technique-tracks-plant-photosynthesis-from-space.html) and innovative ways to improve existing approaches (Nature Plants: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-017-0006-8 ).

Dr Terry Cocks graduated from the University of Adelaide and firstly joined the CSIRO Division of Cloud Physics to develop techniques for the remote sensing of cloud properties.  He then joined the CSIRO Division of Mineral Physics to develop airborne instrumentation for the remote sensing of the earth’s surface for applications in geological mapping and mineral exploration. 

In 1989, he left CSIRO to start Integrated Spectronics (now IntSpec Systems), a company to develop and market spectral sensing instruments.  The company released the first hand held SWIR spectrometer for in-field mineral analysis (PIMA) and later the HyMap series of airborne hyperspectal scanners.  The company also developed a field spectrometer for horticultural applications and a prototype imaging spectrometer suitable for deployment on UAV’s 

In 1998, he founded HyVista Corporation to undertake contract airborne hyperspectral surveys and deliver processed maps to clients.  HyVista Corporation went on to become a significant supplier of imagery and maps to a world-wide range of government agencies, research institutions and commercial organisations such as mining companies.
