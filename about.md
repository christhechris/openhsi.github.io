Brad’s research is focused on the use of Earth Observation, using spectral cameras, UAV’s, Aircraft, CubeSats and Satellites to enhance our understanding of the Carbon and Water cycle. In a practical sense, this involves mapping and modelling plant growth, crop yield and other plant related activities remotely. This research is achieved through using the state-of-the-art in sensors, Hyperspectral Imaging Spectrometers, Thermal imagers and a range of Multispectral and Spectroscopy based approaches.

Brad has been a Director of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network Ecosystem Modelling and Scaling Infrastructure, and Director of Sydney Informatics Hub.

In recent years, Brad has worked on novel ways of mapping plant growth (E.g. NASA’s OCO2 based Solar Induced Fluorescence based model: https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/10/13/new-technique-tracks-plant-photosynthesis-from-space.html) and innovative ways to improve existing approaches (Nature Plants: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-017-0006-8 ).

Dr Terry Cocks graduated from the University of Adelaide and firstly joined the CSIRO Division of Cloud Physics to develop techniques for the remote sensing of cloud properties.  He then joined the CSIRO Division of Mineral Physics to develop airborne instrumentation for the remote sensing of the earth’s surface for applications in geological mapping and mineral exploration. 

In 1989, he left CSIRO to start Integrated Spectronics (now IntSpec Systems), a company to develop and market spectral sensing instruments.  The company released the first hand held SWIR spectrometer for in-field mineral analysis (PIMA) and later the HyMap series of airborne hyperspectal scanners.  The company also developed a field spectrometer for horticultural applications and a prototype imaging spectrometer suitable for deployment on UAV’s 

In 1998, he founded HyVista Corporation to undertake contract airborne hyperspectral surveys and deliver processed maps to clients.  HyVista Corporation went on to become a significant supplier of imagery and maps to a world-wide range of government agencies, research institutions and commercial organisations such as mining companies.
